"""P39: where CP-SAT overtakes the policy as instances grow.

At 10x25 the fair-warm solver has passed the policy on all eight regimes by 30 s
(Sec. S-XII, p30_anytime.py). This asks the same question at 20x25 (440 ops) and
30x25 (660 ops): how far up the budget ladder does the crossover move as the
instances get larger?

For each (size, regime) it reports the CROSSOVER RUNG -- the smallest wall-clock
budget at which the credited CP-SAT mean makespan reaches or beats the policy
mean, credited by the Protocol's min(warm start, search) exactly as p30 does. If
no measured rung crosses, it reports 'not by <largest rung>'.

Everything about the CP-SAT campaign is the 10x25 protocol with only the instance
size changed: same best-of-four warm start, same crediting, same 8 workers x 2
jobs, same policy (greedy+10x25+family+joint-v1, three seeds, makespan column,
averaged). The policy and dispatching-rule numbers are REUSED from the E6
scale-transfer campaign; the policy is not re-evaluated here.
