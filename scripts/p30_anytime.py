"""P30: when does the exact solver actually overtake the policy?

The main paper says that where setups are active, "an exact solve below roughly ten
seconds returns nothing better than the rule it started from". Only 5 s and 30 s were
ever measured, so the ten-second threshold was an interpolation across a gap in the
evidence rather than a measurement. The gap turns out to be exactly where the
interesting thing happens.

This reads the fair-warm CP-SAT campaigns at 1, 2, 5, 10 and 30 seconds and
reports, per regime and per budget. The warm start is the repaired best-of-four
hint (scripts/p41_repaired_warm_cache.py): the 5s and 30s rungs were re-solved from
it (10x25_fairwarmR{5,30}s), while the 1s/2s/10s rungs, not re-solved, have their
credited value floored at the repaired hint. Per regime and per budget it reports:

  * how many of the instances the SEARCH improved on the warm start it was handed,
    which is the quantity the claim is actually about; and
  * the policy's lead over the solver's credited makespan, under the Protocol's
    min(warm start, search) rule.

WHAT THE MEASUREMENT MUST NOT BE. A wall-clock budget on a contended machine is not
a budget: a starved solver returns a worse schedule and reports no error, which
would make the solver look weak and the policy look strong. Every rung here ran
pinned to cores that no other job could enter, and the isolation was PROVED rather
than assumed: rerunning the published 5 s rung on those cores reproduced all 100 of
its objectives and all 100 of its warm starts exactly, instance by instance. A rung
that cannot show that is not admissible evidence and is not reported.
