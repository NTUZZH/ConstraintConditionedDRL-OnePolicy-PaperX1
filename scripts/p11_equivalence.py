"""Formal equivalence testing for the parity claims (E1, E2).

Paired bootstrap (20k resamples, rng seed 7) of the mean per-instance relative
makespan gap, against a +-1% margin. Emits every Eq* macro the manuscript prints.

SYMMETRY IS THE INVARIANT. Both sides of every comparison are pooled over the
SAME seed set, per instance, and the script REFUSES to certify a comparison whose
two sides had different seed pools. This is not a formality. Pooling three seeds
on one side against one seed on the other averages the noise out of that side
only, and the verdicts move: it is enough to turn a breach of the equivalence
margin into an apparent pass. A verdict that depends on the estimator is not a
verdict. The script prints how many seeds each side actually had, so an
asymmetric run is visible rather than silent.

THE SUPERIORITY VERDICTS ARE ONE FAMILY. An equivalence verdict asserts a
pre-specified margin; a SUPERIOR verdict is a discovery, and the paper makes
more than one. E3 Holm-corrects its fifteen Wilcoxon tests, and the headline
claims cannot be held to a lower standard than the mechanism probes: every
certified SUPERIOR verdict carries a two-sided bootstrap p from the same draws
as its interval, Holm-adjusted across the family of such claims. The
equivalence verdicts are margin assertions, not discoveries, and stay
uncorrected.

Pooling three seeds narrows every interval toward the pooled conclusion, so
each certified verdict is also recomputed one seed at a time, single seed on
BOTH sides, and the seed least favorable to the claim is emitted next to it.
The pooled verdict stays the verdict of record; the worst seed shows how much
of it the pooling bought.
