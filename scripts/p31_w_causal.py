"""P31: is the joint policy's W deficit less experience, or joint training itself?

E1 reports the joint policy inferior to its specialist on W. The manuscript put that
next to the fact that the shaping envelope assigns WINDOW the trivial lower bound,
and a reader joins the two. The join does not hold, for a reason that needs no
experiment at all: THE W SPECIALIST IS
TRAINED WITH THE SAME REWARD. Eq. (2) gives WINDOW delta = 0 whoever is training, so
an omission both policies share cannot explain a gap between them. Worse, E7 finds
that the envelope's tightness does not measurably change what the policy learns, so
the mechanism the manuscript gestured at is one its own experiment says is inert.

The envelope explanation is therefore dead by deduction. What remains is a real
question with two answers, and this script is the experiment that separates them:

  EXPERIENCE     The joint sees W on a sixth of its batch. Over 2000 updates that is
                 2000 * 20 / 6 = 6,667 W episodes, against the specialist's
                 1000 * 20 = 20,000. A third. Perhaps any policy given a third of the
                 W experience would land where the joint lands.

  INTERFERENCE   Or perhaps training on five other regimes actively costs something
                 on W, and a specialist with the same experience would still do
                 better.

THE CONTROL. A W specialist trained for 333 updates: 333 * 20 = 6,660 episodes, the
joint's W experience to within a rounding error. Same architecture (asserted at
32,786 parameters, the specialist's own count), same token-blind configuration, same
seeds, same validation schedule. The ONE difference is the budget.

WHAT THE ANSWER MAY NOT BE. Seed 301 says experience: the third-budget specialist is
WORSE than the joint. Seed 302 says the opposite. A single seed here would tell
whichever story its author preferred, which is exactly the failure this project has
already caught itself in once, over a claim that W degrades during training. So the
verdict is the pooled, symmetric, paired one the paper uses everywhere else, the
per-seed spread is printed beside it, and if the interval straddles the margin the
script says so instead of picking a side.
