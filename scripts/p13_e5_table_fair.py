"""Rebuild the E5 table (Table III) and every E5 macro from one source.

Two conventions make the exact-solver comparison fair, and both move numbers
AGAINST the learned policy:

  * CP-SAT is warm-started from the BEST of the four dispatching rules on each
    instance, not from a fixed rule. Seeding it from MWKR alone would understate
    it badly, because MWKR is weak precisely on the setup-bearing regimes. The
    four rules are the mask-respecting (repaired) variants: each rule picks only
    among jobs that hold a legal machine pair, and the stored hint is floored at
    the original best-of-four so it can only be stronger (p41_repaired_warm_cache).
  * CP-SAT is CREDITED with that warm start. AddHint is a search suggestion, not
    a solution: at a short budget the solver can report UNKNOWN, or an incumbent
    worse than the complete feasible schedule it was handed, while that schedule
    is still in hand. Each cell is therefore min(hint, search), which is what a
    practitioner would hold when the budget expires. Cells where the search
    improved on the warm start on NO instance carry a dagger: there the solver's
    reported value IS the repaired best-of-four portfolio.

The policy's own latency comes from results/policy_latency_cpu.json, written by
p16_policy_latency.py on an unloaded machine. It is deliberately NOT taken from
column 1 of the evaluation result files: those timings were recorded during bulk
evaluation, and on a workload where every instance has the same operation count a
wide spread in them measures contention, not computation.

Writes results/e5_table_fair.md, paper/macros_e5.tex, paper/tables/e5_table.tex.
