"""P27: what does a NEWLY trained joint policy do, as opposed to the three we trained?

E1 reports paired bootstrap intervals over the 100 test instances, with both sides
pooled over the same three training seeds. That interval answers a real question:
for the policies we trained, is the gap to the specialist inside the margin on this
benchmark? It does NOT answer the question a plant actually asks, which is whether
the ONE policy it trains tomorrow will land inside the margin. The first question
treats the test instance as the unit of inference. The second treats the TRAINING
RUN as the unit, and we have three of those, not a hundred.

This script computes the second one and refuses to dress it up. It reports, per
regime:

  * the gap under each individual seed, joint-s vs specialist-s, SYMMETRICALLY --
    seed 301's joint against seed 301's specialist, never against a pooled one.
    Pooling one side and not the other is the exact error that put a false SW
    result in an earlier figure, and it is not repeated here.
  * a two-level bootstrap interval: resample the three seeds with replacement
    (outer), then the hundred instances with replacement (inner). This propagates
    training-run variability into the interval.
  * the same margin verdicts at +-0.5%, +-1% and +-2%, because a verdict that only
    holds at the margin its authors chose is a verdict about the margin.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT MAY NOT PRETEND. A bootstrap over three points is a bootstrap over
three points. The outer resample can only ever draw from {s301, s302, s303}, so the
interval it produces is a coarse, conservative gesture at seed-level uncertainty and
not a proper estimate of it. Three seeds cannot certify a seed-level claim, and the
paper must not say they can. What the three seeds CAN do is show the reader the
spread directly, which is why the per-seed gaps are emitted as macros and printed as
a table: three honest numbers beat one dishonest interval. If the seed-level interval
is wide, the correct conclusion is not "the policy is unreliable" and not "the claim
survives" -- it is that the instance-level verdict is scoped to the policies we
trained, and the seed-level question is open at n=3.

Emits macros_seed.tex.
